    Executes a function in parallel with shared memory between the processes.

    The array must have been created using
    parallel.utility.create_shared_array(shape, dtype).

    If the input array IS NOT a shared array, the data will NOT BE CHANGED!

    The reason for that is that the processes don't work on the data, but on a
    copy.

    When they process it and return the result, THE RESULT IS NOT ASSIGNED BACK
    TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL, it is discarded.

    - imap_unordered gives the images back in random order
    - map and map_async do not improve speed performance
    - imap seems to be the best choice

    Using _ in the for _ enumerate is slightly faster, because the tuple
    from enumerate isn't unpacked, and thus some time is saved.

    From performance tests, the chunksize doesn't seem to make much of a
    difference, but having larger chunks usually led to slower performance:

    Shape: (50,512,512)
    1 chunk 3.06s
    2 chunks 3.05s
    3 chunks 3.07s
    4 chunks 3.06s

    8 chunks 3.25s
    9 chunks 3.45s
